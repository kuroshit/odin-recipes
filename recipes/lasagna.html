    <h2>World's Best Lasagna</h2>
    <p>Great recipe, I'll be making this again and again. And finally, I found a lasagna that doesn't fall apart on a plate but isn't dry either! I read a lot of the reviews before deciding on how I was going to make this for the first time. I made the following changes: 1) used 1 lb of ground beef plus the sausage, 2) added a can crushed tomatoes to the sauce to make it a little heartier 3) substituted red wine for the water (wow did that improve the flavor!) 4) added only 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt to the sauce 5) doubled the Italian Seasoning 6) omitted the fennel (don't like it) 7)used 1 lb of mozzarella cheese 8) added 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 8) cooked the noodles by placing them in hot water for 30 mins (worked well, they turn out perfect) 9) used dried parsley because I didn't have fresh stuff. The two things I wish I'd have known prior to making this: use the deepest dish you can find or you won't fit all the layers, and if you like the white cheezy part of the lasagna, you'll definitely need to double the ingredients for the ricotta cheese mixture. The recipe makes barely enough to fully cover my 9 X 13 dish. Hope this helps! Happy cooking!</p>
